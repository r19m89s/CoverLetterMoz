To Whom It May Concern:

The manner in which Mozilla views software is very much in-line with my personal beliefs about how software should be organized and treated. When I read the manifesto that was shared on your main website, I felt relieved that there was an organization that viewed the intersection between tech and the outside community in such a refreshing way. 

My love for technology began in high school, grew through college, and grows even now. We had computer science classes in my high school, in which I learned Java, BASIC, and C. In my senior year, I built a computer using entirely open source software and recycled parts in my hardware class. During college, I programmed in C++ and C for about 5 years, even building a compiler and a web page as part of my senior year projects. After college, I worked as a developer for several different coporations (X2CRM, Urbics, On-Site and TubeMogul), but never really felt like I had found my niche. 

I have only been granted the ability to participate in technology within both insular corporate environments and within my education, but my non-profit work, living in several co-operatives  made me excited about the intersection of my two passions. When I was in high school, I volunteered as a tutor for two young youths at a neighboring middle school and through a program that my parents told me about. Being  a tutor taught be about the transformative power of education, and the importance of sharing one's educational privelege. The housing co-operatives I lived in taught me about the importance of insular and outside communities. 

There should be less of a hierachy and knowledge bias within the way that we share technology. Both open source software and education attempt to breach the gap between the larger community and those who are currently contributing to technological advancements. Both are inherently important in both the advancement of technology and the current socio-economic climate. Mozilla is attempting    a breach of this gap by holding hackathons, and by placing imporatance on open-source software.
The organization sounds wonderful and like something I would love to contribute to.
