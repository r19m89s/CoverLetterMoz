To Whom It May Concern:

The manner in which Mozilla views software is very much in-line with my personal beliefs about how software should be organized and treated. When I read the manifesto that was shared on your main website, I felt relieved that there was an organization that viewed the intersection between tech and the outside community in such a refreshing way. 

My love for technology began in high school, grew through college, and grows even now. We had computer science classes in my high school, in which I learned Java, BASIC, and C. I became so excited about this opportunity that I became part of the AP track, which led me to  building a computer using entirely open source software and recycled parts in my hardware class.  This project introduced me to the power and potentiality of open soure. During college, I programmed in C++ and C for about 5 years, even building a compiler and a web page as part of my senior year projects. I fell in love with the structure of C++, participating in extra-curricular projects during the summers.  After college, I worked as a developer for several different coporations (X2CRM, Urbics, On-Site and TubeMogul), but never really felt like I had found my niche. 

I have only been granted the ability to participate in technology within both insular corporate environments and within my education, but my non-profit work and living in several co-operatives  made me excited about the intersection of my two passions. When I was in high school, I volunteered as a tutor for two young youths at Roosevelt Middle School (in San Francisco) and through a  program that was run for the neighborhood middle schoolers. Being a tutor both taught me about the educational disparities that can exist, and about the importance of using my educated privilege to help others that might not have the same access as I do. In college, I lived at both the Zami and Chavez housing co-operatives in Santa Cruz, and lived there for long enough that I became part of a national co-operative board. Being part of this board taught me about how to organize a community outside of my own localized one, the importance of strengthing this community, and how a common shared interest can breach socially instilled gaps. 

There should be less of a hierachy and knowledge bias within the way that we share technology. Both open source software and education attempt to breach the gap between the larger community and those who are currently contributing to technological advancements. Both are inherently important in both the advancement of technology and the current socio-economic climate. Mozilla is attempting    a breach of this gap by holding hackathons, and by placing imporatance on open-source software.
The organization sounds wonderful and like something I would love to contribute to.
